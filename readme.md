# carnival

`carnival` aims to create a single website to showcase great games made by the community of `repl.it`. games span across many genres - some even have multiplayer support!

the project is in early development. if you have a suggestion, feel free to [add one](https://github.com/repl-it-discord/carnival/issues/2). this project also has a channel on the [repl.it discord server](https://repl.it/discord) if you wish to chat real time!
